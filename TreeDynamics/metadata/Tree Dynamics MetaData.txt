Meta Data for Tree Dynamics Data:

The tree dynamics data contains multiple compiled projects for trees in the SEADYN Hondo plots. It contains tree dimensions analysis with tagged tree measurements for stem height, lean, and crown area in the Hondo stands in 1983; stem mapping data that looked at tree root coordinates, fallen stems dimensions, and tree diameter for each tagged tree in 1983; tree ages, determined with core samples, for the tagged trees in 1983; tree diameter and heights in 1991 and 2000; and fire codes for 2001. 

Notes from the 2003 cleaning are found in SEADYN stand dynamics (TREE) 1981-2001 word doc.

Data was cleaned and compiled again as part of the Living Data Project in 2021 by Jenna Loesberg.

Each column refers to:

stand: Hondo stand number (1-8)

plot: quadrat number

species_code: 4 letter code for species. On data sheets, they used one letter codes, listed as: A = POTR, B = BEPA, F = ABBA, J = PIBA, L = LALA, P = POBA, S = PIMA, W = PIGL. One letter codes were switched to 4 letter codes in the 2021 data cleaning.

DBH_1983_cm: diameter at breast height (at 1.3 m height)

base_coord_[N or S]_1983_m: Root coordinates. Numbers indicate distance from North OR South boundary. Only one coordinate will be filled! If rooted on plot boundary, number will be zero.

base_coord_[E or W]_1983_m: Root coordinates. Numbers indicate distance from East OR West boundary. Only one coordinate will be filled! If rooted on plot boundary, number will be zero.

fallen_stem_length_1983_m: length of fallen stem from root to apex. Optional if apex in same plot as root. Blank if stem didn't fall. 

exit_coord_[N or S]_1983_m: coordinates where fallen stem exits plot containing root, or the coordinates of the apex in same plot as root. Numbers indicate distance from North OR South boundary. Only one coordinate will be filled! If on plot boundary, number will be zero. Blank if stem didn't fall. 

exit_coord_[E or W]_1983_m: coordinates where fallen stem exits plot containing root, or the coordinates of the apex in same plot as root. Numbers indicate distance from East OR West boundary. Only one coordinate will be filled! If on plot boundary, number will be zero. Blank if stem didn't fall. 
	
year_dead: year observed dead

year_fallen_1983: year observed fallen

age_1983: estimated ages of trees in 1983 in years. Ages were taken for all tree with greater then 3" DBH with bores and number of rings counted to use to estimate year growth.

stem_height_1983_m: height of tree in 1983

**stem_lean_amt_scaled_1983: amount of scale (scaled): o's look like they correlate with Z's - means they weren't leaning -- we cant figure out what these are (there are many variables used). Leaving these in in the hope that we can find something. S, M, and L definitely refer to small, medium, and large according to old emails, but dont know what the H, N, E, 0 and O refer to! Also not sure if 0 and O are different.

stem_lean_dir_1983: Direction of lean (cardinal direction), Z = zero lean

stem_lean_amt_1991: degrees

stem_lean_dir_1991: lean direction

stem_lean_amt_2000: degrees

stem_lean_dir_2000: lean direction

crown_width_NS_1983: Crown width N-S: width of the crown of the tree (m) from north to south

crown_width_EW_1983: Crown width E-W: width of the crown of the tree (m) from east to west

height_to_crown_m:  height of bottom of tree to crown (m) 

fill_perc_1983: how dense the crown was - this is a guess, there are no descriptions in the data

BSD_1983: basal diameter 1983 in cm - this is a guess, there are no descriptions in the data

radial_10year_inc_1983_mm: radial increment for the last 10 years in mm

DBH_1991_cm: diameter at breast height (1.3 m height)

DBH_cm_2000: diameter at breast height (1.3 m height)

height_2000_m: stem height in 2000
			
tree_code_2000 = LB: live and broken top (height is more than 1m shorter than previous height measured) - heights measured by Vertex hypsometer. LL: live and leaning (more than 100 - estimated by eye). DS: dead and standing (top intact, or break is less than 1m from top). DD: dead and down. DB1: dead and broken below breast height (1.3m) - i.e. tag not on snag. DB2: dead and broken above breast height (1.3m) - i.e. tag on snag. DL: dead leaning (more than 100 - estimated by eye). 

fire_code_2000: We are not sure what the variable codes are. Also, if this is a fire code for after the 2001  fire, this should be 2001, not 2000.

comments from 2003 cleaning effort
Statement at bottom of Stand 1 data:
Trees that fell in 1986 and 1987 are recorded as 87 because the 1986 data was not available when data entered into file.  Some trees that fell but are alive were recorded as only fallen, their length and direction of fall is not recorded, but this information should be taken in 1989.
